        VMG started more than 5 years ago in Indonesia to sell moving advertisement. They not only put advertisement on the taxi, but they wrap the taxi with the brand, product or service campaign! This was new in the market of Indonesia. After 2 years, the first
        success came in Bali (Denpasar), many local businesses and even government started to use the service of VMG. It didn’t take very long and the rest of Indonesia followed. Now VMG is the leader in Indonesian market.

      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6">
        <ul>
          <li class="text-justify white">Taxi advertisement started already more than 10 years ago in cities like New York, Paris and London. Taxis drive 15-20 hours a day and come into every corner of the city. In many big cities, the traffic is very busy and the taxis are driving
            slow or even standing still, this is a big plus for the ads on the taxi.</li>
          <br>  <br>
          <li class="text-justify white">Taxis are a practical part of everyday city life and are used and seen by financial high-fliers, business decision makers, shoppers, wealthy residents, tourists, household purchasers, passers-by and other motorists.</li>

        </ul>

      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6">
        <ul>
          <li class="text-justify white">Taxi advertising is a very cost-efficient marketing tool for its users - Compare to other conventional method of advertising like newspapers, radio, TV and billboards, taxi advertising has a higher audience reach and impact. It has the ability
            to reach part of the city that is difficult or impossible to reach by other traditional means of advertising at a fraction of the cost.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li class="text-justify white">Taxi advertising stands out as the most powerful technique in marketing and advertising. This moving outdoor display advertising is constantly sending your message to the public and unceasingly putting your brand in front of your customers anytime
            of the day.
